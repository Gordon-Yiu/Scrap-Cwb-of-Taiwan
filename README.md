# V1.1.2

This is actually a mini project while I learned Python during Jan-July Year 2015.
Here I learn by myself and try to build a function that could crap the cwb of Taiwan (official weather observation and prediction institure of Taiwan).
Firstable a very simple function is provided for people interested in doing so. It is good to see what is actually very simple. But there is very limited funciton here, no error check, simple information, no argument. Therefore a formal function with plenty of feature is provided. You can get a lot of information with it. And of course, this becomes too complicated to trace. It is paradox of life :-). Anyway here I provide a simple way and a formal way (which is complicated).
